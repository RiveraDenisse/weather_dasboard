# WeatherDashboard
Week 6 project was to build a weather dashboard with the following criteria:
-Form inputs

-When the user inputs a city and then current and future weather conditions are displayed
    -future conditions must present a 5-day forecast displaying weather conditions, temperature, windspeed and humidity

-The search will include city's name, date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity,windspeed, and UV Index

    -UV Index must indicate if conditions are favorable, moderate or severe by color coding
-The city is then added to the search history
